Erectile dysfunction (ED) is defined as the inability to achieve and maintain the penile erection necessary for sexual intercourse for at least 6 months.The prevalence of ED generally varies between 37.2%-48.6%.\n\nThere are various treatment methods used in individuals with ED symptoms. While urologists use oral phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor drugs (such as sildenafil and vardenafil) as the first step, intracavernosal papaverine or alprostadil injections and vacuum devices may be preferred afterwards. When these treatments are inadequate, penile prostheses can be used. In addition, various physiotherapy techniques such as pelvic floor muscle training, electrical stimulation, massage and aerobic exercises are also recommended for these individuals."

                    "briefSummary": "This phase I clinical trial studies how well low intensity shockwave therapy (LiSWT) improves erectile function in patients who have had nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy (NS-RP), a type of surgery that attempts to save the nerves near the tissues being removed, for prostate cancer. Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a known side effect of the radical prostatectomy procedure. The low intensity shockwave therapy delivers painless electrotherapy pulse to increase blood flow and supply, activation of tissues and wound healing. Using LiSWT after NS-PRP may improve erectile function in men with prostate cancer.",
                    "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To determine whether LiSWT following nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy (NS-RP) improves outcomes in men with erectile dysfunction (ED) supported by cGMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor (PDE5i) medication.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine whether LiSWT improves duplex doppler ultrasound (DDUS) flow parameters at 6 months following LiSWT treatment.\n\nII. To determine the postoperative durability of any beneficial outcome of LiWST treatment to erectile function.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\n\nARM I: Patients undergo nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy per standard of care. Patients then receive LiSWT treatment weekly for 6 weeks, then have a 6 week break, followed by 6 more weekly treatments. Patients also undergo DDUS at baseline and during follow up.\n\nARM II: Patients undergo nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy per standard of care. Patients then receive sham LiSWT treatment weekly for 6 weeks, then have a 6 week break, followed by 6 more weekly treatments. Patients also undergo DDUS at baseline and during follow up."

The investigators believe that Irrisept provides adequate antibacterial and antifungal coverage to serve as an alternative to traditional antibiotic therapy. Additionally, the investigators believe a cost analysis would support the use of Irrisept in the event that non-inferiority is demonstrated."

                    "briefSummary": "Single-arm phase II trial of 70 men with low- or intermediate-risk prostate cancer receiving magnetic resonance guided adaptive radiotherapy (MRgRT) in 5 fractions of 7.25 Gy, additionally sparing the neurovascular bundles, the internal pudendal arteries, the corpora cavernosa, and the penile bulb for erectile function preservation.",
                    "detailedDescription": "Rationale: Erectile dysfunction is a frequent side effect of external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) for prostate cancer. To date, anatomy-based treatments that are designed to spare relevant neurovascular structures such as the internal pudendal artery and neurovascular bundles have not yet been routinely implemented in clinical practice. The implementation of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in treatment planning and introduction of Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy (IMRT) and Volumetric Arc Therapy (VMAT) have improved treatment precision and enabled anatomy-based EBRT and neurovascular-sparing treatments. Spratt et al. have conducted a single-arm phase 2 study to investigate the effect of vascular-sparing IMRT treatments, and found a significantly improved 2-year erectile function (78%, 95% confidence interval \\[CI\\] 71-85%) compared to conventional radiotherapy (42%, 95% CI 38-45%; p\\<0.001) or nerve-sparing prostatectomy (24%, 95% CI 22-27%; p\\<0.001). In the UMCU, the state-of-the-art MRI linear accelerator (MR-Linac) has recently been introduced. This new system allows radiation delivery under high-precision MRI visualization. The MR-Linac is therefore the most suitable technique for neurovascularsparing external beam radiotherapy treatments. Such neurovascular-sparing treatments may substantially improve post-radiotherapy erectile function outcomes and can thus improve quality of life without substantially compromising oncologic outcome.\n\nObjective: To investigate preservation of erectile function after MR-guided radiotherapy with neurovascular-sparing in patients with localized prostate cancer.\n\nStudy design: The EREctile function preservation for prostate Cancer radiation Therapy (ERECT) trial is a prospective, single-center, phase 2 trial. Patients will be treated with the MR-Linac up to 5 fractions of 7.25 Gy with neurovascular-sparing. All fractions will be delivered over the course of 2 and a half weeks.\n\nStudy population: Men with low- and intermediate-risk adenocarcinoma of the prostate, clinical stage T1c-T2c, and Gleason \u22647, and iPSA \\<20 \u00b5g/L (NCCN risk categories). Patients with pT1a/b tumor diagnosis after transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) are included, patients with \"bulky\" iT3 tumor diagnosis are excluded. Baseline erectile function score according to the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) questionnaire of at least 17.\n\nIntervention: All patients will receive MR-Linac treatment consisting of 5 fractions of 7.25 Gy with neurovascular sparing, Fractions will be delivered with an overall treatment time of two and a half weeks.\n\nMain study parameters/endpoints:\n\nPrimary endpoint: the incidence of erectile dysfunction (ED) three years after treatment.\n\nSecondary endpoints: relapse-free survival, acute and late genitourinary and gastrointestinal toxicity and patient reported quality of life.\n\nNature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group relatedness: Participants will receive neurovascular sparing MR guided radiation therapy (MRgRT) consisting of 5 fractions of 7.25 Gy. The number of fractions and duration of treatment is similar to conventional MRgRT consisting of 5 fractions of 7.25 Gy. No increase in toxicity is expected as the dose constraints for the organs at risk in the neurovascular sparing plan will be identical to the conventional plan (i.e. bladder, rectum, femoral head and anal sphincter). For neurovascular sparing treatment, the protocol is extended with dose constraints for newly identified organs at risk (i.e. neurovascular bundles (NVB), internal pudendal arteries (IPA), corpora cavernosa (CC) and penile bulb (PB)). Attention for these organs at risk during treatment planning may reduce erectile dysfunction for the neurovascular sparing treatment. The dose to the dorsolateral part of the prostate might be lower in the NVB sparing plan as the NVB lies in close proximity to this part of the prostate. A slight dose concession on the dorsolateral part of the prostate will only be permitted if the visible tumor on multiparametric MRI is not in vicinity of the NVB as underdosage of the dominant index lesion is undesirable for tumor control. A lower dose to the dorsolateral part of the prostate may have an impact on biochemical control for certain cases, but we do not expect that it will influence overall survival."

                    "briefSummary": "According to epidemiological surveys in various countries around the world, the prevalence of erectile dysfunction in men over the age of 40 is about 40%. Previous angiography studies have shown that nearly 70% of erectile dysfunction patients do have pelvic arterial stenosis. Our team leads the world in the use of percutaneous angioplasty combined with drug-eluting stents or paclitaxel-coated balloons to delineate the stenosis of the pelvic pudendal artery and penile artery The successful report of erectile dysfunction shows that the 12-month erectile function improvement rate is nearly 60%, and the vascular restenosis rate is also about 40% to 50%, obviously there is room for improvement. This study aims to observe the clinical efficacy, safety and lower restenosis rate of the newly developed \"Selution SLR\u2122 sirolimus drug sustained-release coated balloon\" in patients with distal internal pudendal artery and penile artery stenosis complicated with erectile dysfunction . Compared with drug-eluting stents and paclitaxel drug-coated balloons, the Sirolimus drug-coated balloon has two advantages: one is that the clinical performance of sirolimus is much better than that of paclitaxel when used in drug-eluting stents; the other is that there is no indwelling stent in the Therefore, it can reduce the local stimulation of blood vessels and maintain the biological activity of blood vessels. Selution SLR\u2122 sirolimus drug sustained-release coated balloon has obtained European Union approval for marketing, and has also been granted four Breakthrough Device Designation Status by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA): coronary artery disease, coronary artery disease In-stent restenosis, infra-knee artery disease, and arteriovenous canals.",
                    "detailedDescription": "Study Design\n\n1. Prospective, randomized, single-blinded, two-arm, single-center, first-in-man, proof-of-concept trial.\n2. Safety and efficacy measures will be monitored and collected by the study physician/coordinator at hospital discharge, 2 weeks, 1, 3 (12 weeks), 6, and 8 (7-9, study end) months after the index procedure.\n3. For patients developing binary restenosis at 12 weeks, angioplasty with Selution SLR drug-eluting balloon (in the drug-eluting balloon \\[DEB\\] arm) or plain old balloon (POB)(in the POB arm) will be performed thereafter and secondary patency will be evaluated 5 months later, the originally defined 8-month follow-up.\n\nTarget Population\n\n1. Patient profile: Patients with erectile dysfunction according to International Index of Erectile Function-Erectile Function (IIEF-EF) score and distal internal pudendal and/or penile artery stenotic disease identified by pelvic computed tomography angiography (CTA) and confirmed by invasive angiography.\n2. Inclusion criteria 2.1 Men \u226520 years of age with erectile dysfunction defined as an IIEF-EF score of \u226425 points; 2.2 The anatomical inclusion criteria, based on pelvic CT angiography, are luminal diameter stenosis of \u226550% in the distal internal pudendal and/or penile arteries with proximal reference vessel diameter of \u22651.5 mm and a target-lesion length of \u226440 mm.\n\nPatients and Sites A total of 54 patients, with at least 54 evaluable lesions, from National Taiwan University Hospital will be enrolled in this trial. 1:2 randomization (18 and 36 in plain old balloon group and Selution group, respectively) will be performed. Pre-specified interim analyses for the primary efficacy outcome measure with an option to prematurely end the study will be conducted while 12, 20, 28, and 36 patients complete evaluation of the primary efficacy measure.\n\nPrimary Efficacy Endpoint CT angiographic binary restenosis (\u226550% lumen diameter stenosis) at 12 weeks follow-up.\n\nPrimary Safety Endpoint The rate of major adverse events at 12 weeks after intervention, defined as procedure-related death, occurrence of perineal hematoma, gangrene or necrosis (glans penis, penile shaft, scrotal, or anal), or the need for subsequent perineal, penile, or anal surgery (including target-lesion or vessel revascularization or arterial embolization procedures).\n\nSecondary Endpoints\n\n1. Invasive angiographic binary restenosis (\u226550% lumen diameter stenosis) at 8 (7-9) months follow-up;\n2. CT angiographic binary restenosis (\u226550% lumen diameter stenosis) at 8 (7-9) months follow-up;\n3. Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS)-based binary restenosis (\u226550% averaged lumen diameter stenosis) at follow-up;\n4. Peak systolic velocity of treated-side cavernosal artery of \\>35 cm/sec by penile duplex ultrasonography at 12 weeks;\n5. Technical success defined as residual diameter stenosis of \u226430% with adequate distal run-off (TIMI 3 flow) by invasive angiography 3 minutes after angioplasty with Selution SLR;\n6. Change of IIEF-EF score at 1, 3, 6, and end of follow-up;\n7. Clinical success defined as change of IIEF-EF score from baseline by \u22654 points or IIEF-EF \u226526 at 1, 3, 6, and end of follow-up;\n8. Clinical worsening defined as decrease in IIEF-EF score from baseline by \u22654 points at 1, 3, 6, and end of follow-up;\n9. Changes of invasive angiographic and IVUS parameters, including diameter, diameter stenosis, and late loss between 8 months and baseline;\n10. Changes of CT angiographic parameters, including diameter, diameter stenosis, and late loss between 8 months and baseline;\n11. Changes of penile duplex ultrasonographic parameters (peak systolic flow, RI) between follow-up and baseline;\n12. The rates of major adverse events, defined as procedure-related death, occurrence of perineal hematoma, gangrene or necrosis (glans penis, penile shaft, scrotal, or anal), or the need for subsequent perineal, penile, or anal surgery (including target-lesion or vessel revascularization or arterial embolization procedures), at 1, 3 months, 6 months, and end of follow-up.\n\nStatistical Considerations\n\n1. Sample size estimation: Assuming a binary restenosis rate of 8% with Selution SLR sirolimus-eluting balloon versus a historical restenosis rate of 40% in patients treated with plain old balloon in our PERFECT registry, a minimum of 54 evaluable lesions in 54 patients with a 1:2 randomization ratio (18 and 36 in plain old balloon group and Selution group, respectively) was considered necessary to have a statistical power of 80% and a 2-sided p\\<0.05 to detect a treatment difference in binary restenosis. Pre-specified interim analyses for the primary efficacy outcome measure with an option to prematurely end the study will be conducted while 12, 20, 28, and 36 patients complete evaluation of the primary efficacy measure.\n2. Statistical analysis This prospective, randomized, single-blinded (patient), two-arm, single-center, superiority study is a feasibility trial designed to provide preliminary observations and generate hypotheses for future studies. Continuous variables will be presented as means with standard deviations (SDs). Categorical variables will be presented as counts and percentages. Statistical comparisons between treatment groups will be made using t tests for continuous variables and \u03c7\u00b2 or Fisher's exact tests for categorical variables. Within each treatment group, paired t tests will be used to compare changes in continuous variables from baseline to follow-up.\n\nInclusion Criteria\n\n1. Men \u226520 years of age with erectile dysfunction defined as an IIEF-EF score of \u226425 points;\n2. The anatomical inclusion criteria, based on pelvic CT angiography, are luminal diameter stenosis of \u226550% in the distal internal pudendal and/or penile arteries with proximal reference vessel diameter of \u22651.5 mm and a target-lesion length of \u226440 mm;\n\nExclusion Criteria\n\n1. The presence of diameter stenosis of \u226570% in the ipsilateral internal iliac artery, anterior division of internal iliac artery, and/or proximal internal pudendal artery, which could not be successfully treated by angioplasty and stenting;\n2. Any non-vascular cause of erectile dysfunction (i.e., pelvic irradiation, pelvic trauma, Peyronie's disease, etc.), which is deemed irreversible by urologist;\n3. Untreated hypogonadism (serum total testosterone \\<2.5 ng/ml) within 28 days before enrollment;\n4. Isolated penile veno-occlusive dysfunction (venous leak) by duplex ultrasonography with right or left cavernosal artery end-diastolic velocity \\>10 cm/s, peak systolic velocity \\>40 cm/s, and resistance index (RI) \\<0.75;\n5. Acute coronary syndrome, stroke, or life-threatening arrhythmia within 3 months before enrollment;\n6. Poorly controlled diabetes mellitus with glycosylated hemoglobin levels \\>9%;\n7. Serum creatinine levels \\>3.0 mg/dl;\n8. Bleeding diathesis precluding the use of antiplatelets or anticoagulants or known hypercoagulopathy;\n9. Any malignancy or debilitating disease with life expectancy of fewer than 12 months;\n10. Known intolerance to contrast agents, aspirin, heparin, all P2Y12 inhibitors, or sirolimus.\n\nProcedure All patients will be admitted one day prior to the procedure and receive aspirin (100 mg daily) and clopidogrel (75 mg daily and 300 mg loading one day before intervention) 24 h prior to the procedure. Selective angiography and internal pudendal/penile artery interventions will be performed on the second day of hospitalization. All procedures will be done percutaneously by an over-the-bifurcation (for the contralateral lesions) or a retrograde (for the ipsilateral lesions) approach via a single femoral vascular access with the use of a 6-French sheath. The investigators routinely engage the proximal internal pudendal artery by using a 5-French diagnostic/guiding catheter and obtain the selective angiograms following intraarterial administration of 150-200 microg of nitroglycerin to achieve maximal vasodilatation. Use of any phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor within 72 hours of the procedure will be prohibited.\n\nPatients will proceed with investigational intervention if their quantitative angiographic results fulfilled the following angiographic inclusion criteria: 1) luminal diameter stenosis of \u226550% in the distal internal pudendal and/or penile arteries, 2) a target-lesion proximal reference vessel diameter \u22651.5 mm, and 3) a target-lesion length \u226440 mm. Patients will be excluded if there is \u226570% stenosis in the ipsilateral ilio-pudendal-penile arterial system proximal to the distal internal pudendal artery and not amenable to interventional therapy.\n\nAfter confirmation of angiographic eligibility, patients will receive 8,000 U of heparin to maintain an activated clotting time \u2265250 s. Selective engagement of the internal pudendal artery will be performed with an appropriate-shaped 5-French guiding catheter. A 0.014-inch steerable guidewire will be advanced across the stenosis and IVUS and standard interventional techniques will be applied to the lesion. In order to prevent inadvertent dissection during predilation, the investigators routinely start with a balloon catheter with a diameter \u22650.5 mm smaller than the reference vessel and ended with a balloon catheter with the size approximately equal to the reference vessel diameter. Three minutes after balloon predilation, the investigators will obtain an angiogram. Randomization will take place before angioplasty. If the residual stenosis is \u226430%, no further intervention will be performed in the plain old balloon (POB) group. While in the drug-eluting balloon (DEB) group, the investigators will perform angioplasty with the Selution SLR catheter, inflated at nominal pressure for at least 120 seconds. After dilatation of the entire target-lesion, biplane angiograms and IVUS imaging will be obtained. Technical success is defined as residual diameter stenosis \u226430% and adequate distal run-off. Bail-out stenting will be performed if residual stenosis is \\>30%, either after plain old balloon angioplasty or angioplasty with Selution SLR. For lesions with residual stenosis \\>30% but not suitable for stenting, repeat angioplasty will be performed for at most twice.\n\nAfter intervention, patients will be discharged in the morning of the third day of hospitalization. Post-procedural antiplatelet therapy include aspirin (100 mg daily) indefinitely and clopidogrel (75 mg daily) for a minimum of 3 months.\n\nPatient Follow-up\n\n1. Safety and efficacy measures will be monitored and collected by the study physician/coordinator at hospital discharge, 2 weeks, 1, 3, 6, and 8 (7-9, study end) months after the index procedure. Participants will be encouraged to contact the study physician/coordinator directly by phone whenever the participants feel any discomfort, no matter it is related to the procedure or not.\n2. For patients developing binary restenosis at 12 weeks, angioplasty with plain old balloon (in the POB arm) or Selution SLR drug-eluting balloon (in the DEB arm) will be performed thereafter and secondary patency will be evaluated 5 months later, the originally defined 8-month follow-up.\n3. For patients developing binary restenosis at 8 months, angioplasty with Selution SLR drug-eluting balloon will be performed. All these patients will be followed for additional 6 months.\n\nSafety Monitoring Safety events including procedure-related death, occurrence of perineal hematoma, gangrene or necrosis (glans penis, penile shaft, scrotal, or anal), or the need for subsequent perineal, penile, or anal surgery (including target-lesion or vessel revascularization or arterial embolization procedures) will be collected by the study physician/coordinator at 1, 3, 6 months, and study end after the index procedure."

After that they will be randomized in two groups (A with drainage, B without drainage) using a random sequence generator. Then the patient will undergo the implantation of a three-component penile prosthesis following peri antibiotic prophylaxis with cephalosporins and aminoglycosides, the antibiotic prophylaxis will be continued on the first post-operative day surgery with a cephalosporin. In the group A it will be positioned at the scrotal level (using surgical access or using a second incision) an external drainage (10 Ch in aspiration) for 24 hours. The drainage will be removed on the first post-operative day. The degree of the hematoma will be determined using a 5-point Likert scales already approved in previous cases. Subsequently patients will carry out periodic check-ups at 7, 15 and 30 days after the operation to evaluate the appearance of hematomas and surgical site infection. After that, they will carry out check-ups every month for the first 3 months, then every 3 months for the first year and finally annually up to the fifth year after the intervention. During the clinical check-ups, it will also be defined the time of use of the penile prosthesis."
